This file provides guidance to GitHub Copilot when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal website (corent-in.vercel.app) built with Next.js, TypeScript, and various modern web technologies.
The site uses the Next.js App Router and is designed to be deployed on Vercel. It includes features like blog posts (
notes), projects showcase, contact form, and hit counter API.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Start production server
pnpm start

# Lint code
pnpm lint

# Type check
pnpm typecheck

# Generate database migrations (using Drizzle)
pnpm db:generate

# Apply database migrations (using Drizzle)
pnpm db:migrate
```

## Environment Setup

The project requires several environment variables to function properly. The environment variables are documented and
type-checked in `lib/env.ts`. Use `.env.example` as a template if a `.env` or `.env.local` file does not already exist.

Required server environment variables:

- `AUTH_SECRET`: Random value for authentication encryption
- `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: Client ID from GitHub OAuth App
- `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: Client secret from GitHub OAuth App
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (Neon)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub API token for projects page
- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Resend API key for contact form
- `RESEND_TO_EMAIL`: Destination email for contact form

Required client environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_REPO`: Repository in format "username/repo"
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_USERNAME`: GitHub username

## Architecture

### Core Technologies

- **Next.js App Router**: Modern React framework with server components
- **TypeScript**: Type safety throughout the project
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling with utility classes
- **Drizzle ORM**: Database interactions with type safety
- **Better Auth**: Authentication system
- **MDX**: For notes/blog content with enhanced features
- **Neon PostgreSQL**: Serverless database

### Database Schema

The Drizzle ORM database schema is defined in `lib/db/schema.ts`.

### Content Structure

- `/app`: Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `/components`: React components organized by feature
- `/lib`: Utility functions and configurations
- `/notes`: MDX content for blog posts
- `/public`: Static assets

## Development Considerations

1. When using ANY library, always use `use context7` to lookup documentation from the context7 MCP server, which
   provides access to all project-specific configuration files and standards

2. Always prefer React Server Components (RSC) over client components

3. React components follow patterns from Tailwind v4 with shadcn/ui components

4. The project assumes deployment to Vercel and makes use of Vercel-specific features

5. When working with MDX content, note the custom plugins and transformations in `next.config.ts`

6. Database operations use Drizzle ORM with Neon's serverless PostgreSQL client

7. The repository uses strict linting and type checking through ESLint and TypeScript

## External Documentation Lookup

1. The Context7 MCP server is available to reference documentation for any library or dependency

2. Before installing any package, running commands, or creating/updating dependency files, you MUST use `use context7`
   to retrieve the most up-to-date and authoritative documentation for the relevant stack, library, or technology

3. Do NOT rely solely on model training data or general knowledge; Context7 must be consulted for all dependency and
   setup actions
