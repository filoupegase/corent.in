## Howdy, friends! ðŸ‘‹

If you examine [my homepage](/) long enough, you might notice the ðŸ‘‹ hand emoji at the top subtly waving at you. This was easily accomplished using a few lines of CSS with a feature called [`@keyframes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes) â€” no bulky GIFs involved, and no JS mess or jQuery overkill required.

Below are the code snippets you can grab and customize to make your own ["waving hand" ðŸ‘‹](https://emojipedia.org/waving-hand-sign/) emojis **_actually wave_**, and a [CodePen playground](https://codepen.io/filoupegase/pen/NWOYwvN) for live testing.
