You may have noticed the recent trend of techies [posting their "dotfiles" on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/dotfiles) for the world to see. These usually contain shortcuts compatible with Bash terminals to automate convoluted commands that, I'll admit, I needed to Google every single time.

Make a new directory and change directories into it.

```bash
function mkcd() {
    if mkdir -p -- "$1"; then
      cd -- "$1" || return
    fi
}

```

Check your current local IP address:

```bash
alias iplocal="ipconfig getifaddr en0"
```

This odd hack is needed to run any of these aliases as sudo:

```bash
alias sudo="sudo "
```
