## üß∂ Getting Started

Run `pnpm install` to install the necessary dependencies and `pnpm run dev` to start the local server, and then
open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). Pages will live-refresh when source files are
changed. ([pnpm is required!](https://pnpm.io/installation))

Most production steps are
handled [automatically by Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/next.js/overview#supported-next.js-features), but
running `pnpm build` locally will still generate an unoptimized, less-than-ideal static version.

**‚ö° Bonus tip:** [Volta](https://volta.sh/), a magical, blazing-fast alternative
to [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), is used to pin the exact Node.js version used for development. It's completely
optional but I highly recommend it in general!
